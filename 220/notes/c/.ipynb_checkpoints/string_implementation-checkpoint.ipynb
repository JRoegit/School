    "## A string struct\n",
    "\n",
    "The C mechanism for creating a user-defined type is a struct (or possibly multiple structs) that stores the\n",
    "data needed by the type and a set of functions that provide functionality of the type. The struct (or structs)\n",
    "and functions are typically declared in a header file that users `#include` in their programs. The functions\n",
    "are typically implemented in one or more C source code files. Our string type will be implemented with a\n",
    "struct having the tagname `qstr`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct qstr {\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of zero or more characters. \n",
    "The *length* of a string is the number of characters in the string, not including any special terminator characters.\n",
    "Our implementation stores the length of the string in an unsigned integer member of the struct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct qstr {\n",
    "    size_t length;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an array of `char` to store the sequence of characters. \n",
    "Furthermore, our functions will ensure that the sequence is null terminated to maintain\n",
    "interoperability with the standard C library. Unlike ordinary C strings, we will allow a `qstr`\n",
    "to contain zero or more null terminator characters in its sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because structs are not allowed to have variable\n",
    "length arrays as members, our struct stores a pointer to the first element of the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct qstr {\n",
    "    size_t length;\n",
    "    char *data;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could use a flexible array member for the array (see the last section of the *struct* notebook\n",
    "for links to further information).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our implementation stores the capacity of the array so that operations that change the length of\n",
    "the string can determine if the array must be reallocated to obtain additional memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
