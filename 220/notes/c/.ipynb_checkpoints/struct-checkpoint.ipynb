    "A struct is a composite data type that groups one or more variables under a single name in a block of memory.\n",
    "The variables, called *members*, can be accessed via the struct object. A struct somewhat resembles a\n",
    "Java top-level class where all of the fields are public (and there are no methods or constructors). Like\n",
    "a Java class, a struct allows the programmer to create a new type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The members of a struct may have any type with the exception that variable length arrays are not allowed.\n",
    "Arrays of a constant specified length are allowed.\n",

    "## Declaration and definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A *forward declaration* of a struct is an incomplete declaration of a struct type. It simply states that\n",
    "a struct type with the specified name exists (and will be defined at a later point).\n",
    "The syntax for a forward declaration of a struct is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct tag_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `tag_name` is the name of the struct. The name of a struct, enumeration, or union is called a *tag*\n",
    "and no two tags may have the same name. Somewhat confusingly, a tag may have the same name as a function,\n",
    "variable, or `typedef` name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward declaration of a struct simply states that the tag name exists and belongs to some struct definition.\n",
    "The struct must be fully declared before it is used. The syntax for a complete declaration of a struct is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct tag_name {\n",
    "    type1 member1;\n",
    "    type2 member2;\n",
    "    // and so on\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a simple struct is a struct that represents a two-dimensional point having real\n",

    "struct point2 {\n",
    "    double x;\n",
    "    double y;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",

    "The typename of a struct includes the `struct` keyword. For example, the typename of the \n",
    "`point2` struct is `struct point2`.\n",

    "Once a struct is declared, variables of the struct type may be declared:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct point2 p;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the members of `p` are uninitialized and the programmer must not assume anything\n",

    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "A struct object can be declared and initialized in a manner similar to initializing an array. For example, we\n",

    "\n",
    "```c\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "* integer objects are initialized to unsigned `0`\n",
    "* floating point objects are initialized to positive `0.0`\n",
    "* all array elements and all nested struct members are empty-initialized, recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an error to specify more initializers than there are members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Members may be initialized by name, in any order, using designators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct point2 p = { x = 0.1, y = 0.2 };\n",
