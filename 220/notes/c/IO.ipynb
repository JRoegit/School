    "## The `FILE` type\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure that represents a stream in C is an opaque type called `FILE`.\n",
    "A `FILE` object stores all of the information needed to control an I/O stream, and precisely what\n",
    "information is stored in the data structure is not readily available to the programmer nor is it specified\n",
    "by the C standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer should never attempt to create a `FILE` object directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> FILE objects are allocated and managed internally by the input/output library functions. \n",
    "> Donâ€™t try to create your own objects of type FILE; let the library do it. \n",
    "> Your programs should deal only with pointers to these objects (that is, FILE * values) \n",
    "> rather than the objects themselves.\" <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Streams.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when working with opaque types, it is common to always use a pointer to the type instead of using\n",
    "the type directly. All of the standard library functions that deal with streams use a `FILE *` pointer when\n",
    "specifying a stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard streams\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three standard streams opened and ready for use when the `main` function runs on a hosted environment\n",

    "```\n",

    "In Bash, these streams correspond to standard input, standard output, and standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffering\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O operations are often buffered. Data is stored in a temporary buffer until the buffer is full\n",
    "(or manually flushed) and then full contents of the buffer are transferred. This is\n",
    "done because I/O operations can have high latency. Individual streams can have their own buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stream can be in one of three buffered states:\n",
    "\n",
    "* unbuffered\n",
    "    * data is transferred as soon as possible when it appears\n",
    "    * on Linux systems, `stderr` is typically unbuffered because it is assumed that the system user wants\n",
    "    to see error and warning messages as soon as they are written\n",
    "* fully buffered\n",
    "    * data is transferred when the buffer is full\n",
    "    * streams that read/write to files are usually fully buffered because writing to an external storage device\n",
    "    is typically orders of magnitude slower than CPU and memory operations\n",
    "* line buffered\n",
    "    * data is transferred as entire lines (delimited by newline character)\n",
