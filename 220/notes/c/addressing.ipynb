    "A *bit* or *binary digit* is the fundamental unit of information in digital computers. The value of a bit can be\n",
    "one of two possible states. The two possible states are often given the integer values `0` and `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest model of computer memory is to view memory as an array of bits. Each bit can be read or\n",
    "written to using a zero-based array index or *address*. The following table illustrates $n$ \n",
    "bits of memory all set to `0`:\n",

    "## Word addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the bit is the fundamental unit of information in digital computers, general purpose processors\n",
    "do not typically operate on single bits of data. For example, text-based tasks involve operating on\n",
    "characters and numeric tasks involve operating on integer or floating-point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processors are designed to work with information of a fixed length number of bits called a *word*. The number\n",
    "of bits in a word is called the *word length*. When someone uses a phrase such as \"64-bit processor\" they are\n",
    "often referrring to a processor having a 64-bit word length. Modern desktop and mobile processors have word\n",
    "lengths of 64 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer architecture that supports access to each word of memory is called *word addressable*. Consider\n",
    "a word addressable processor having 6-bit words; each memory address maps to a non-overlapping group\n",
    "of 6 bits. The following table illustrates $n$ \n",
    "words of memory where each word has all of bits set to `0`:\n",
