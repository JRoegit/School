    "## Implementing a stack using a linked sequence of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a stack using a linked sequence of nodes, we maintain a pointer `top` that points\n",
    "at the current top node\n",
    "of the stack. For convenience, we also maintain the count of the number of elements in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an empty stack. There is no current top node and the number of elements is equal to zero.\n",
    "We can draw a picture of such a stack like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![An empty stack](./images/stack_0.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![A stack with one element](./images/stack_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the stack has only one element, there is no node for the next element; this is indicated by the arrow pointing to `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we push the integer `2` onto the top of the stack. Our stack now looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A stack with two elements](./images/stack_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `top` now points at the node holding the element `2`, and that node is linked to the node\n",
    "that previously held the top element.\n",

    "\n",
    "![A stack with three elements](./images/stack_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the nodes are linked in a linear structure. It is possible to reach any node in the sequence by starting from the `top` node and following the link to the next node in the\n",
    "sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure shown above is called a *singly linked list* because it represents a sequence of elements where each element is joined by one link.\n",

    "Pushing an element onto to the top of the stack always requires a constant number of elementary operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make a new node to hold the element\n",
    "2. set the link of the new node to point to the current `top` node\n",

    "\n",
    "An opaque type created with a struct has no user-accessible members. The fact that the type is a struct\n",

    "to the type. This can be achieved by using C's `typedef` mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `typedef` allows the programmer to create an alias for the name of another type. The syntax for a `typedef` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "typedef type-name alias;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `type-name` is the name of a type and `alias` is the name that we want to use instead of the actual\n",
    "type name.\n",

    "Suppose that we wanted to write `qstring` instead of `struct qstr` when referring to our type. Then we\n",
    "could use a `typedef` to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "typedef struct qstr qstring;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `typedef` declaration, we can write code such as the following:\n",

    "```c\n",
    "qstring *course = qstr_fromcstr(\"CISC220\");\n",

    "useful information. When you use a `typedef`, the actually type information is no longer present in the\n",
    "variable declaration which leads to a loss of possible useful information.\n",
