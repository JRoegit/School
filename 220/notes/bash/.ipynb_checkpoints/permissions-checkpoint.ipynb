    "\n",
    "#### 1. File type and permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost symbol denotes the file type of the file. There are seven standard file types\n",
    "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types). Some of the file types that readers might encounter \n",
    "in this course are described in the following table.\n",

    "* `rw-` the *user* permissions\n",
    "* `rw-` the *group* permissions\n",
    "* `r--` the *other* permissions\n",

    "The symbols always appear in the same order: read-write-execute. An `r` indicates that read permission\n",
    "is granted. A `w` indicates that write permission is granted. An `x` indicates that execute permission \n",
    "is granted. A `-` means that the particular permission is not granted. In the example, we can see that\n",
    "the owner of the file has read and write permission, members of the group have read and write permission,\n",

    "| Permission | Regular files |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| read | File can be opened and read |\n",
    "| write | File can be written to or truncated. Does not allow creation, deletion, or renaming |\n",
    "| execute | File can be run like a program or executed as a script |\n",
    "\n",
    "| Permission | Directories |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| read | Directory contents can be listed if execute permission is also granted |\n",
    "| write | Files can be created, deleted, or renamed if execute permission is also granted |\n",
    "| execute | Directory can be entered |\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol in the execute positions can also be `s`, `S`, `t`, or `T`, but these permissions\n",
    "are beyond the scope of this notebook.\n",

    "#### 2. Number of hard links\n",
    "\n",
    "See the *Filesystem* and *Creating, moving, removing, and copying files* notebooks for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Username\n",
    "\n",
    "The username is name of the user that owns the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Groupname\n",
    "\n",
    "The groupname is name of the group that the file belongs to. On many Linux distributions, every\n",
    "user has a group named after them called a *user private group* and the default group that a file is assigned to\n",
    "is the user private group. The owner of the file may assign the file to a different group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Disk size \n",
    "\n",
    "The disk size on the author's computer is listed in bytes, but this can be changed by other\n",
    "command line options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "The timestamp is the modification time on the author's computer. The modification time is the last\n",
    "time the file contents were modified.\n",
    "\n",
